## Question 2

### The way to hack

- The command "crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u avazquez -p Password123 --pass-pol" is used to execute the CrackMapExec tool on the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol to the IP address 172.16.5.5. Here is a detailed explanation of the parameters and options in the command:
    - "crackmapexec": The name of the tool used.
    - "smb": The target protocol, in this case SMB.
    - "172.16.5.5": The IP address of the server or device to be checked.
    - "-u avazquez": Username (-u) is "avazquez". This is the username used to log in or perform access checks on SMB.
    - "-p Password123": The password (-p) is "Password123". This is the password used to log in or perform an access check on SMB.
    - "--pass-pol": The option (--pass-pol) is used to check if the password has been complied with the system's password policy. If this option is enabled, the tool checks if the password has been set according to security requirements such as minimum length, special characters required, uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers, etc.
